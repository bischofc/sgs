Attention:
----------
This has not yet been tested properly. Use with caution.


Note:
-----
If "Rscript" is available a graph will be generated.
If "gv" is available the graph is shown.
If not the raw output can be found in "simulation.out"


Build:
------
$ mkdir build
$ cd build

$ cmake ..                                    (to use the default install dir: ~/tmp/sgs)
OR
$ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/install/path  (to use a custom install dir)

$ make


Install:
--------
make install


Run:
----
goto install dir

$ ./exec.sh
(runs a default simulation)

$ ./exec.sh timesteps resolution consumers
(runs a custom simulation)


Hint:
-----
timesteps: steps (simulated time depends on resoultion)
resolution: 1h/x -> x=60 would be a resolution of *one minute*
consumers: number of consumers to be simulated

The default setting is: 10080 60 100
This means *10080* timesteps with a resolution of *one minute* and *100* consumers.
simulated time: *10080* timesteps with a resolution of *one minute* simulates -> *one week* ((10080 / 60)h / 24 = 7d)

It is a litte confusing.. maybe I'll change it later.
